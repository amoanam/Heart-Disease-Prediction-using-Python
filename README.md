# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Python
Heart failure diseases now affect more people globally than any other autoimmune condition. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) affect the heart and kill approximately 17 million people each year, and death rates from heart diseases have risen since the COVID-19 pandemic.Python libraries for data loading, management, and model building, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn, are well known for assisting in the development of robust data science applications.

This project will predict whether a person has 'Heart disease' or not. The outcome will be divided into two classifications such as;
1 (One) as Having heart disease
0 (Zero) as Healthy
Choosing Dataset;
The dataset will be used in this project is from 'kaggle', link is "https://www.kaggle.com/priyanka841/heart-disease-prediction-uci".
